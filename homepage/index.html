<div class= "bio"> I'm Noya, my style seeks to incorporate the physicality of fine art into the digital world of coding. I was born in Bangalore, India and I am forever influenced by abstract artists such as M.F. Hussain, Joan Miro, and Egon Schiele. My goal in my designs is to bring chaotic order into an algorithmic world. My Website is an abstract painting. Welcome to my art. </div>
